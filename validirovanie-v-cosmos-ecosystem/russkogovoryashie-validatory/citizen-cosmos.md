**Краткий рассказ о себе:**

"Citizen Cosmos is an ecosystem developer in the web3 universe. In simple terms, this means that we are somewhat of a city manager, working directly - for, and with the city and its citizens, read - token holders. This is opposed to working with a third party, i.e. someone that represents the voice of the people, like a mayor. The catch is, our cities are decentralized, censorship-free, open and verifiable blockchain networks. Hence, we are not a mayor or a third party, we are part of the voice of a community.

We believe that blockchains should be viewed as digital nations and by using the tools that we hold, we help to build and bring value to these nations. Our tools vary, but for now include a web3-focused podcast, streams, social media, educational content, hackathons, distributed validator infrastructure and our offline network, which allows us to help dev teams to form strategic partnerships, especially at earlier stages.

We are also starting to work with offline projects, such as local artists, galleries, permaculture communities, etc. Helping educate them about crypto, and sometimes, investing into them by donating crypto.

What's in it for us? We monetize ourselves via our validators. If we believe that a city can be prosperous and it meets our values, we start to work around it. In turn, the citizens of the city, read - blockchain users, delegate tokens to our validators, which helps us to keep going.

For now, Citizen Cosmos is primarily focused on Tendermint, Cosmos-SDK and Ethereum, but not only. Our podcast is focused on the interchain, and we validate Cosmos-based networks. We cover events as a media outlet, organize and sponsor events, create educational content and help people to dive into the rabbit hole.

Our goals are much bigger. We strive and build to becoming the layer-0, i.e. - a community bridge between ecosystem. "
